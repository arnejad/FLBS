		     MNI Average Brain (305 MRI)
		    Stereotaxic Registration Model

This is a version of the MNI Average Brain (an average of 305
T1-weighted MRI scans, linearly transformed to Talairach space)
specially adapted for use with the MNI Linear Registration Package
(mni_reg).  Included in this package are the following files:

     average_305.mnc 
	a version of the average MRI that covers the whole brain
        (unlike the original Talairach atlas), sampled with 1mm cubic
        voxels
     average_305_mask.mnc 
	a mask of the brain in average_305.mnc, semi-automatically
        created by Dr. Colin Holmes <colin@pet.mni.mcgill.ca>.  Note
        that this mask has had holes filled in, so it is a connected
        volume but includes non-brain tissue (eg. the CSF in the
        ventricles)
     average_305_headmask.mnc 
	another mask, required for nonlinear mode

Here's a brief summary of what you need to do:

1) Build and install the entire MNI AutoReg package, as described in
   the README with that package. 

2) Install the model:
     * ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mni
	     or where you installed mni_autoreg

     * make

     * make install

Now, you're ready to try out mritotal on real data.  See the file
TESTING included with MNI AutoReg for instructions on doing this.

Any problems with this package should be reported to
